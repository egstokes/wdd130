    <p1>Hello everyone, great to "meet" you and have this opportunity to share a bit about myself. I am originally from Eugene, OR, but I moved to Mesa, AZ, 
        last July and have been loving it here! my major is in Business Management, and I am currently enrolled in my very last semester here at BYUI--I am very excited to graduate.</p1>
    <p>In my free time I love to play video games, board games, watch movies, and go hiking (when the weather permits). I come from a bit family and am the youngest of 7 kids, and I think my
        love for those things really came from growing up doing those activities together and bonding with family over them.</p>
    <p>I think taking this course in web design will be really helpful and give me a good insight into the digital realm. I work in ecommerce as a sales rep, and so I am excited to understand
        a bit more about how things work on the backend of the website that I use on a daily basis. I think that with a basic understanding of how websites function I can provide more value to my current and future employers.</p>
