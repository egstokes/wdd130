            <h1>Creation</h1>
            <p>In the beginning the gods compressed matter into the material plane. With their combined power they then proceeded to surround the material plane with the elemental planes of Fire, Earth, Water and Air. Out of the darkness they created the Abyss, the Nine Hells and the Shadowfell and out of the light they created the Astral Plane and the Feywild. Once the gods finished creating their planes they created twenty dragons. There were ten male and ten female of every dragon type. These dragons would later be split into two distinct groups: Chromatic and Metallic. The gods gave the dragons great power of specific elements and had them use their abilities to shape the lands of the material plane. For nearly a millenia dragons ruled the material plane in peace, growing in number and using their abilities to cultivate and refine the material plane. After some time the gods gave the dragons the ability to create dragonborn, a separate entity from their regular offspring. These dragonborn would be the dragons servants. All this was done with the intent that other creatures would someday share the material plane with the dragons. These creatures would consist in part of Humans, Dwarves, and Elves. While the gods created many other creatures these three would be their most prominent. From the beginning the dragons knew of this plan and accepted it. Once the gods felt the material plane was ready (after a millennia) they sent these other races to the material plane and with the dragons aid they began to flourish, but as time went on some of the dragons and their offspring began to feel like the godâ€™s plan was unfair, and so they began to rebel against them. This was when a clear rift was formed between the dragons. The metallic dragons wanted to uphold the gods plans and the chromatics did not. And thus a great rift was created and the world was torn by war. Only after centuries of war did the forces of the metallic dragons push back those of the chromatic. However, in this process, both sides were nearly destroyed to extinction.</p>
