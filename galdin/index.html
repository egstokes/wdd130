            <p>The Land of Galdin: 300 years ago The Unum Imperium crossed The Great Blue, leaving their lands of origin that lie to the north, due to their expanding empire experiencing growing pains in need of resources. Sending scout ships across the sea, these men discovered Galdin. Hoping to find new lands untouched and ripe for the taking, they were surprised to find a land that was inhabited by many sentient beings - the most prominent being the likes of elves, dwarves, and Dragonborn. The men of the Imperium immediately sought to subjugate these new lands and saw the potential for expansion in this new land, more so than they had ever imagined. The Emperor at the time, Padiff III, took the approach of treachery in order to gain control of this new land and came under the guise of peace and friendship, but quickly showed his true intentions.

Deemed a closer relative to their human ancestors, elves were treated favorably and have even kept positions of nobility under the Imperium, dwarves are treated mostly with indifference and have been deemed to have used due to their knowledge of smithing and great ability to mine.</p>

            <p>Dragonborn are considered to be essentially animals and usually fill the role of a serving class. Other races like halflings and gnomes are treated with much indifference and aren’t really considered to be good for anything of note aside from filling the roles of standard peasants under the Imperium. The Unum Imperium has a strong aversion to what is deemed to be “unholy” magic. Magic is often associated with the demonic and unnatural and banned under the Imperium’s rule. Only those who serve under the Inquisition of the Circle Striders - an elite group of clerics who serve in the Church of the High Imperious. All those who do not have the Circle’s approval to use or even study magic are</p>
