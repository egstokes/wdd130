The Unum Imperium has a strong aversion to what is deemed to be “unholy” magic. Magic is often associated with the demonic and unnatural and banned under the Imperium’s rule. Only those who serve under the Inquisition of the Circle Striders - an elite group of clerics who serve in the Church of the High Imperious.
