      The Land of Galdin:

      300 years ago The Unum Imperium crossed The Great Blue, leaving their lands of origin that lie to the north, due to their expanding empire experiencing growing pains in need of resources.

      Sending scout ships across the sea, these men discovered Galdin. Hoping to find new lands untouched and ripe for the taking, they were surprised to find a land that was inhabited by many sentient beings - the most prominent being the likes of elves, dwarves, and Dragonborn. 

      The men of the Imperium immediately sought to subjugate these new lands and saw the potential for expansion in this new land, more so than they had ever imagined.

      The Emperor at the time, Padiff III, took the approach of treachery in order to gain control of this new land and came under the guise of peace and friendship, but quickly showed his true intentions. The first to succumb to Imperium was the Dragonborn, shortly after the dwarves and elves fell under their power after much confusion and bloodshed.

      Deemed a closer relative to their human ancestors, elves were treated favorably and have even kept positions of nobility under the Imperium, dwarves are treated mostly with indifference and have been deemed to have used due to their knowledge of smithing and great ability to mine. Dragonborn are considered to be essentially animals and usually fill the role of a serving class.

      Other races like halflings and gnomes are treated with much indifference and aren’t really considered to be good for anything of note aside from filling the roles of standard peasants under the Imperium.

      The Unum Imperium has a strong aversion to what is deemed to be “unholy” magic. Magic is often associated with the demonic and unnatural and banned under the Imperium’s rule. Only those who serve under the Inquisition of the Circle Striders - an elite group of clerics who serve in the Church of the High Imperious. All those who do not have the Circle’s approval to use or even study magic are deemed a heretic and are punished as such.

      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>
        Creation: In the beginning the gods compressed matter into the material plane. With their combined power they then proceeded to surround the material plane with the elemental planes of Fire, Earth, Water and Air. Out of the darkness they created the Abyss, the Nine Hells and the Shadowfell and out of the light they created the Astral Plane and the Feywild. 

        Once the gods finished creating their planes they created twenty dragons. There were ten male and ten female of every dragon type. These dragons would later be split into two distinct groups: Chromatic and Metallic. 
        
        The gods gave the dragons great power of specific elements and had them use their abilities to shape the lands of the material plane. For nearly a millenia dragons ruled the material plane in peace, growing in number and using their abilities to cultivate and refine the material plane. 
        
        After some time the gods gave the dragons the ability to create dragonborn, a separate entity from their regular offspring. These dragonborn would be the dragons servants. 
        
        All this was done with the intent that other creatures would someday share the material plane with the dragons. These creatures would consist in part of Humans, Dwarves, and Elves. While the gods created many other creatures these three would be their most prominent. 
        
        From the beginning the dragons knew of this plan and accepted it. Once the gods felt the material plane was ready (after a millennia) they sent these other races to the material plane and with the dragons aid they began to flourish, but as time went on some of the dragons and their offspring began to feel like the god’s plan was unfair, and so they began to rebel against them. This was when a clear rift was formed between the dragons. The metallic dragons wanted to uphold the gods plans and the chromatics did not. 
        
        And thus a great rift was created and the world was torn by war. Only after centuries of war did the forces of the metallic dragons push back those of the chromatic. However, in this process, both sides were nearly destroyed to extinction.

      <h3>Maps</h3>
      <p>
        Two key maps are shown below. The first is the map of the world with all it's major locations and highways plotted out. The blue icons represent the human Dutchy of Kent, the organ icons are under the Domain of the Elves, and the green icons are all in the regions of Gravier, the Dwarf Kingdom. Second is Fort St. Denn, a key outpost on the frontier of the lands of humanity and a vital defense point against the ever present threats that could head north from the lands of Desolation.
